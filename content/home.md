Welcome to the **Notepub documentation template**.

This repository is designed to work out of the box with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions.

Template branding defaults:

- Header brand name comes from this page frontmatter `title`.
- Header brand logo comes from `site.default_og_image` in `config.yaml`.

Use this path to get started quickly:

1. [[Getting Started]]
2. [[Configuration]]
3. [[Build and Deploy]]

The sidebar structure demonstrates hub-based navigation that scales from small docs to larger knowledge bases.
